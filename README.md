# MATLAB_APP_on_treadmill_control_and_self-pacing_algorithm_implementation
This is an unofficial video of a walking test which shows how can an instrumented treadmill match a subject's speeds.
Because this is an on-going research, I cannot provide more details. But I include two files to show a small part of my work.

forwardKF.m shows how can I implement kalman filter in our algorithm.

plot_steps.m is a file to process experiment data and plot.
